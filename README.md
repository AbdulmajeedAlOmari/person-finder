# person-finder
A simple project I made in a Session to explain 'Profile' annotation and how to use it in mocking

# Note
Please note that the project have 3 branches: master, initial and final.
- master: A branch that contains project with no features
- initial: Define general structure of application
- final: Final structure of project that contains 'Profile' annotation and how to use it
